<h1>Heart Disease Prediction Project</h1> 

<p>This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on medical data. The prediction model is deployed using a user-friendly Streamlit app, enabling users to input patient data and receive predictions instantly.</p>

<h3>1. What the Project Does</h3>
<p>This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using machine learning models. Users can input patient data (e.g., age, cholesterol level, blood pressure) into a Streamlit app, which outputs a probability of heart disease based on the trained model. Itâ€™s designed to provide quick and accurate insights for medical decision-making.
